## Naming Conventions  
### Branches
For naming branches, it is generally accepted that you will name the branch in two parts.  
The first of these parts will be a categorical name. The second part will be the specific thing that you are working on.  
For example, "category/specific-feature". Notice that the two parts are separated  
using slashes, and for multiple words in-between the dashes, snake case is used. Try to keep the word count below 4.  
Here is a list of the most common categorical names:  
- *structure* - HTML and general file hierarchy.
- *style* - CSS and non-functional modifications.
- *design* - Combination of HTML and CSS; Entire page without interactivity elements modified.
- *database* - Everything that has to do with the backend database.
- *script* - JS and PHP; anything else that adds interactivity to a web page.  
- *refactor* - Rewriting previously written code without changing any core functionality. 
- *dev_tools* - Github and its tools such as workflows.  
- *testing* - Rarely used for niche cases. Typically by the owner of the domain in order to verify that the server and DNS are working as expected.
