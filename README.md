## Naming Conventions  
For naming branches, it is generally accepted that you will name the branch in three parts.  
The first of these parts will be your Github username followed by the general topic.  
For example, "gwizzle-structure-specific_feature". Notice that the three parts are separated  
using kebab case, and for multiple words in-between the dashes, snake case is used.  
Here is a list of the most common categorical names:  
- structure - HTML and general file hierarchy.
- style - CSS and non-functional modifications.
- design - Combination of HTML and CSS; Entire page without interactivity elements modified.
- database - everything that has to do with the backend database.
- script - JS and PHP; anything else that adds interactivity to a web page.  
- dev_tools - Github and its tools such as workflows.  
- testing - rarely used for niche cases. typically by the owner of the domain in order to verify that the server and DNS are working as expected.
